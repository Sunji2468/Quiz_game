# Quiz_game
A fun and interactive general knowledge game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is a simple quiz game where you answer multiple choice questions and get a score at the end. The game shows you if your answers are right or wrong, and gives you feedback based on how well you did. The questions are also shuffled randomly each time you play, so it's different every time.
It was my first time creating a Javascript server, so there were a lot of things i was confused on, so i used AI to help understand them. AI also helped me debug a lot of issues in my code.
